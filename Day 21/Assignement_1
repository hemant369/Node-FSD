            small.<br/>

    <div class="question">
        <h3>Question 5:Why do we use  tbody, tfoot, thead tags in html tables?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><tbody> (Table Body):
            The <tbody> tag is used to group the body content of the table.
            It typically contains one or more <tr> (table row) elements, which in turn contain <td> (table data/cell) or <th> (table header cell) elements.
            While not strictly required, it's considered good practice to use <tbody> to group the main content of the table.
            <tbody> elements allow for easier styling and scripting targeting specific sections of the table.
            <tfoot> <br/>(Table Footer):
            The <tfoot> tag is used to group the footer content of the table.
            It contains one or more <tr> elements, similarly to <tbody>.
            <tfoot> is commonly used to place summary rows or totals at the bottom of the table.
            Placing content in <tfoot> allows it to be visually and semantically separated from the main body content of the table, making it easier for users to distinguish.
            <thead><br/> (Table Header):
            The <thead> tag is used to group the header content of the table.
            It contains one or more <tr> elements, typically containing <th> elements to represent column headers.
            <thead> is used to provide a semantic grouping for the header rows of the table.
            Placing header content in <thead> allows it to be styled separately from the body content, making it easier to differentiate headers from data.</p>
