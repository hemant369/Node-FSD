Question: What is Testing in Software Development? Why do we do testing?
Answer: Software testing can be stated as the process of verifying and validating whether a software or application is bug-free, meets the technical requirements as guided by its design and development, 
and meets the user requirements effectively and efficiently by handling all the exceptional and boundary cases. 

1. Identifying Defects: Testing helps identify defects or bugs in the software early in the development process, making it easier and less costly to fix them.
2. Ensuring Quality: Testing helps ensure the quality of the software by verifying that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly.
3. Improving Reliability: Testing helps improve the reliability and stability of the software by uncovering and addressing potential issues before they impact users.
4. Building Confidence: Testing helps build confidence in the software among stakeholders, including customers, by demonstrating that it has been thoroughly evaluated and meets their expectations.

Question: What is Unit Testing? 
Answer: Unit Testing: Testing individual units or components of the software in isolation to ensure they function correctly. 
Unit tests are typically automated and focus on small, specific pieces of code.

Question: What are benefits of Unit testing?
Answer: 
1. Early Detection of Defects: Unit tests allow developers to identify defects in individual units or components of the software early in the development process. 
2. Improved Code Quality: Writing unit tests often requires developers to design code that is modular, loosely coupled, and well-structured.
3. Faster Feedback Loop: Unit tests can be automated and executed frequently, providing rapid feedback to developers about the correctness of their code.
4. Documentation: Unit tests serve as executable documentation for the behavior of individual units or components of the software.
5. Regression Testing: Unit tests serve as a form of regression testing, ensuring that changes made to the codebase do not inadvertently introduce new defects or break existing functionality. 
By re-running unit tests after each code change, developers can catch regressions early and prevent them from causing larger problems later on.

Question: What is AAA in Unit Testing
Answer: The AAA stands for Arrange, Act, and Assert. This is a great way to make sure weâ€™re covering all aspects of testing a module of code.

Arrange the state of the data to set it up for testing.

Act on the data through some method that performs an action.

Assert that the result from acting on that data is what we expect it to be.
