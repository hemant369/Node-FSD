Question: What is Views in MySQL?
Answer: A VIEW in SQL Server is like a virtual table that contains data from one or multiple tables.
It does not hold any data and does not exist physically in the database. The view name should be unique in a database. It contains a set of predefined SQL queries to fetch data from the database.
It can contain database tables from single or multiple databases as well.

Uses:
1. Views can abstract complex queries or joins into a single, easy-to-use virtual table. 
2. Views can be used to restrict access to sensitive data.
   By granting users access to specific views rather than directly to tables.
3. Views can improve query performance by precomputing and storing the results of complex or frequently executed queries
4. Views can transform data into a more usable or meaningful format.
   For example, you can use views to aggregate data, pivot tables, or perform calculations.


Syantax:
	 CREATE VIEW Name AS  
	 Select column1, Column2...Column N From tables  
	 Where conditions; // not compulsory

Example:
 	CREATE VIEW EmployeeRecords As
	Select name, email, phone, address from Employee
	where gender='M';

	Select * from EmployeeRecords;
